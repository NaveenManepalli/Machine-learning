When using SQL in the context of machine learning, there are several main concepts that you should focus on. SQL (Structured Query Language) is essential for managing and extracting data from relational databases, and it plays a crucial role in preparing data for machine learning tasks. Here are the key SQL concepts you need to focus on:

1. Data Retrieval (SELECT):
   -SELECT statement.
   -filtering data with (WHERE clause)
   -sorting results (ORDER BY)
   -limiting the number of rows (LIMIT).


2. Data Aggregation (GROUP BY, HAVING):
   -aggregate data using functions like COUNT, SUM, AVG, MIN, MAX, etc with the GROUP BY clause to group the data on specific columns.
   -HAVING clause is used to filter aggregated results.


3. Joins:
4. Subqueries: 
5. Data Manipulation (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE):
6. Table Creation (CREATE TABLE):
7. Data Cleaning:
8. Window Functions:
9. Aggregating Time Series Data:
10. Handling Categorical Data: 
11. SQL in Python:
